# Reflections

## 1. Topics I Know Very Well
1. **JavaScript Overview and Syntax**   
   Before the school year started, I did advance reading on this particular topic. This made it easy for me to familiarize myself and get a head start with JavaScript.

2. **Variable Declaration**  
   This is overall a very simple and easy topic to understand. I got perfect in the quiz which covers this lesson and the prior one. 

3. **JavaScript Basic Statements**  
  I understood this lesson well as this is also one of the lessons I did advance reading on. I also liked this lesson as it added 'flavor' to the codes and made it more interesting. 

4. **Control Statements**  
   I understood this well as we already had this topic in C++ aswell. This also made the LT1 Part 2 fun to do cause I found the code easy. 

5. **Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects**  
   This was a short and easy lesson to understand. It also makes coding easier due to the Number Methods adding more freedom.


## 2. Topics I Need More Practice With
1. **JavaScript Operations** – This topic is easy to understand as it's almost basically the same as C++ operations. I just need a bit more practice as there are very few cases where I don't understand the operation.
2. **Loop Control Structures (while, do..while, for..in)** – Sometimes it's hard for me to understand the loop structure. I think it'd help if pen and paper were allowed to use as scratchwork to envision a flowchart for the loop, as that helped me last year. (Thank you Sir Javi)
3. **Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)** – Again, it's hard for me to understand loop structures without a clear imagination of a flowchart. 
4. **Declaring Functions** – Functions are an OK topic, but I feel like I just didn't practice it enough before the last LT. So I feel like I need to look into it more. 
5. **Processing Function Output** – Again, I just need to look into and practice functions more so I can do better with the remaining school year.


## 3. Plan of Action
To improve my grades in CS2, I will start practicing loops and functions more as those two are core parts of any coding language. I'll start watching videos on these topics and strengthen my knowledge on them. I'll also start participating more in class.

## 4. Activities in Class
- **Effective Activities**  
  1. The Kahoot activities helped me as sometimes conceptual questions similar to questions that would appear on a quiz appear on the Kahoot. This helps me gain a better grasp and understanding of the topic, and helps me get a good score in the quiz relating to it.
  2. Coding exercises in class also help out due to Ma'am Aline being there to guide us. It'd be harder to do at home as we wouldn't have Ma'am Aline to tell us whats wrong with our code.

- **Not Effective Activities**  
  1. From what I observed in class, when Ma'am Aline is discussing in front, there are some people who don't listen and just sleep/do things on their computer. I think it'd be better to turn lectures into an entertaining challenge of some sorts, like Kahoots with explanations for example to wake the class up.
  2. Other than that, I really do believe there aren't any other ineffective activities in class. This is cause we mainly just lecture, code, and have an occassional kahoot.
