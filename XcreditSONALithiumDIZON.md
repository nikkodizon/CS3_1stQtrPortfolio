## Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. by Nikko Dizon of 9 - Lithium

This years 2025 State of the Nation Address (SONA) of the Philippines was a fruitful one which I'd like to talk about. 

1. There were several points which piqued my interest, such as the education reforms (Fixing childhood education and development, laptops for public school teachers, pay for teaching overload/overtime, etc.), and the healthcare upgrades (More public hospitals/specialty centers, increased PhilHealth benefits, etc.)
2. There was also one point that I found weird, which is how the Guadalupe Bridge wonâ€™t close and how detour bridge will be made in the meantime. 
3. To reflect on the SONA 2025, I'd like to state that I find delight in what President Marcos Jr. is doing for our country. It's obvious that he's trying to help our people by implementing new programs and such. It's encouraging to see the steps being taken to help out our community, as all of this will lead to our better future. One where all Filipino's can be free and be happy together.  

    It's really nice to see the governments focus on education and healthcare, as these two things are what some regard to be big issues in the Philippines. The way they're enhancing childhood education and development would really benefit our countries future, as it'd help shape more minds to be mature and knowledgeable and not uneducated and irresponsible. The PhilHealth benefit and increased cancer assistance funding really put a smile on my face as it'd help many families across the country who are struggling with medical costs. Overall, this years SONA was a great one, as it prioritzed both our countrys immediate needs and the future. 
4. If I had to give 1 word for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025, it'd be the word "Hope", as this SONA demonstrates a push to enhance the education, healthcare, and livelihoods of us Filipinos
